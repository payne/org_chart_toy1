## Claude Prompt

Create a 200 line CSV file that represents a simple organizational chart.   One line in the CSV corresponds to one person in the company.  Each person can only be managed by one person.  Fields in the line are unique_id, name, manager_id, department_id, department_name.   The unique_id should contain the persons name and extra characters to make it globally unique.  manager_id is the unique_id for the person's manager.

## Claude response 

I'll create a 200-line CSV file representing an organizational chart with the structure you specified. This will include a realistic company hierarchy with various departments.I've created a 200-line CSV file representing a comprehensive organizational chart. Here's what the structure includes:

**Hierarchy Overview:**
- **CEO** at the top (Sarah Chen)
- **C-Level Executives** (CFO, CTO, COO, CHRO, CMO) reporting to CEO
- **Vice Presidents** reporting to C-level executives
- **Senior roles, Managers, and Leads** cascading down
- **Individual contributors** at various levels

**Departments Represented:**
- **Executive (EXE001)** - 1 person
- **Finance (FIN001)** - 50+ people across accounting, analysis, audit, tax, treasury
- **Engineering (ENG001)** - 50+ people across development, QA, DevOps, UI/UX, mobile
- **Operations (OPS001)** - 40+ people across logistics, supply chain, quality, warehouse
- **Human Resources (HR001)** - 30+ people across recruiting, compensation, learning, talent
- **Marketing (MKT001)** - 30+ people across brand, digital, social media, content

**Key Features:**
- Each person has a unique_id that incorporates their name plus role/department identifiers
- Clear reporting structure with manager_id linking to unique_id of supervisors
- Realistic job titles and departmental groupings
- No circular reporting relationships
- Mix of individual contributors and management roles across all levels

The file follows proper CSV format and can be easily imported into spreadsheet applications or databases for organizational analysis.
